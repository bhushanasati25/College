## List of Assignments

## Group A

### Assignment-1:
- [ ] Design  suitable  data  structures  and  implement  pass-I  of  a  two-pass  assembler  for  pseudo-machine  in  Java  using  object  oriented  feature.  Implementation  should  consist  of  a  few instructions from each category and few assembler directives.

### Assignment-2: 
- [ ] Implement  Pass-II  of  two  pass  assembler  for  pseudo-machine  in  Java  using  object  oriented features.  Theoutput  of  assignment-1  (intermediate  file   and  symbol   table)  should  be  input for this assignment.

### Assignment-3: 
- [ ] Designsuitable  data  structures  and  implement  pass-I  of  a  two-pass  macro-processor  using OOP features in Java

### Assignment-4: 
- [ ] Write a Java program for pass-II of a two-pass macro-processor. The output of assignment-3 (MNT, MDT and file without any macro definitions) should beinput for this assignment.


## Group B

### Assignment-1: 
- [ ] Write  a  program  to  create  Dynamic  Link  Library  for  any  mathematical  operation  and  write an application program to test it. (Java Native Interface / Use VB or VC++).
