1.	After downloading and installing Wireshark, we can launch it and click the name of an interface under Interface List to start capturing packets on that interface. For example: if you want to capture traffic on the wireless network, click your wireless interface. We can configure advanced features by clicking the Capture Options.
2.	Wireshark captures each packet sent to or from your system.
3.	Click the stop capture button near the top left corner of the window when you want to stop capturing traffic.
4.	Wireshark uses colours to help us identify the types of traffic at a glance. By default, green is TCP traffic, dark blue is DNS, light blue is UDP traffic, and black identifies TCP packets with problems.
