## List of Assignments

### Assignment-1 :
Write X86/64 ALP to count number of positive and negative numbers from the array 

### Assignment-2 : 
Write  X86/64  ALP  to  perform  non-overlapped  and  overlapped  block  transfer  (with  and without  string  specific  instructions).  Block  containing  data  can  be  defined  in  the  data segment.

### Assignment-3 : 
Write X86/64 ALP to convert 4-digit Hex number into its equivalent BCD number and 5-digit BCD number into its equivalent HEX number. Make your program user friendly to accept the choice from user for:
(a) HEX to BCD b) BCD to HEX (c) EXIT.
Display proper strings to prompt the user while accepting the input and displaying the result. (wherever necessary, use 64-bit registers)

### Assignment-4 : 
Write  X86/64  ALP  to  perform  multiplication  of  two  8-bit  hexadecimal  numbers.  Use successive addition and add and shift method. (use of 64-bit registers is expected)

### Assignment-5 : 
Write X86 ALP to find, a) Number of Blank spaces b) Numberof lines c) Occurrence of a particular character. Accept the data from the text file. The text file has to be accessed during Program_1  execution  and  write  FAR  PROCEDURES  in  Program_2  for  the  rest  of  the processing. Use of PUBLIC and EXTERN directives is mandatory.

### Assignment-6 : 
Write X86/64 ALP to switch from real mode to protected mode and display the values of GDTR, LDTR, IDTR, TR and MSW Registers.

### Assignment-7 : 
Write X86 program to sort the list of integers in ascending/descending order. Read the input from the text file and write the sorted data back to the same text file  using bubble sort  

### Assignment-8 : 
Write  X86  menu  driven  Assembly  Language  Program  (ALP)  to  implement  OS  (DOS) commands TYPE, COPY and DELETE using file operations. User is supposed to provide command line argumentsin all cases.

### Assignment-9 : 
Write x86 ALP to find the factorial of a given integer number on a command line by using recursion.  Explicit stack manipulation is expected in the code.

### Assignment-10 : 
Write 80387 ALP to find the roots of the quadratic equation. All the possible cases must be considered in calculating the roots.

### Assignment-11 : 
Write 80387 ALP to plot Sine Wave, Cosine Wave and Sinc function. Access video memory directly for plotting.

### Assignment-12 : 
Write  80387  ALP  to  obtain:  i)  Mean  ii)  Variance  iii)  Standard  Deviation  Also  plot  the histogram for the data set. The data elements are available in a text file.

### Assignment-13 : 
Write a Terminate but Stay Resident (TSR) program for a key-logger. The key-presses during the stipulated time need to be displayed at the center of the screen.  ORWrite  a  TSR  to  generate  the  pattern  of  the  frequency  tones  by  reading  the  Real  Time         Clock (RTC). The duration of the each tone is solely decided by the programmer.

### Assignment-14 : 
Write 80386 ALP to  implement  multitasking.  Where each task is  supposed to  change the   color of the text displayed at the center of the screen
