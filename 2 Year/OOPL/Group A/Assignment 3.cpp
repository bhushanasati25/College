// Implement a class Quadratic that represents degree two polynomials i.e polynomials of type ax2+bx+c. The class will require three data members corresponding to a, b and c. Implement the following operations:
// 1. A constructor (including a default constructor which creates the 0 polynomial).
// 2. Overloaded operator+ to add two polynomials of degree 2.
// 3. Overloaded << and >> to print and read polynomials. To do this, you will need to decide what you want your input and output format to look like.
// 4. A function eval that computes the value of apolynomial for a given value of x.
// 5. A function that computes the two solutions of the equation ax2+bx+c=0.
