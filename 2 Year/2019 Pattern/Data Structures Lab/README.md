## [Group D]()

### Assignment-25 :
- [ ] A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop” is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for  a  palindrome  is  to  reverse  the  characters  in  the  string  and  then  compare  with  them the  original-in a  palindrome,  the  sequence  will  be  identical.  Write  C++  program  with functions-
1. To print original string followed by reversed string using stack
2. To check whether given string is palindrome or not

### Assignment-26 :
- [ ] In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as (),{},[].   Write   C++   program   using   stack   to   check   whether   given   expression   is   well parenthesized or not.

### Assignment-27 :
- [ ] Implement  C++  program  for  expression  conversion  as  infix  to  postfix  and  its  evaluation using stack based on given conditions: 
1. Operands and operator, both must be single character.
2. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
3. Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.

### Assignment-28 :
- [ ] A classic problem that can be solved by backtracking is called the Eight Queens problem, which comes from the game of chess. The chess board consists of 64 square arranged in an 8 by 8 grid. The board normally alternates between black and white square, but this is not  relevant  for  the  present  problem.  The  queen  can  move  as  far  as  she wants  in  any direction,  as  long  as  she  follows  a  straight  line,  Vertically,  horizontally,  or  diagonally. Write  C++  program  with  recursive  function  for  generating  all  possible  configurations  for 4-queen's problem.

## [Group E]()

### Assignment-29 :
- [ ] Queues  are  frequently  used  incomputer  programming,  and  a  typical  example  is  the creation  of  a  job  queue  by  an  operating  system.

Write  C++ program for simulating job queue.Write functions to add job and delete job from queue

### Assignment-30 :
- [ ] Write  program  to  implement  a  priority  queue  in  C++  using  an  inorder  list  to  store  the items  in  the  queue.  Create  a  class  that  includes  the  data  items  (which  should  be template)  and  the  priority (which  should  be  int).  The  inorder  list  should  contain  these objects, with operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the start of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.

### Assignment-31 :
- [ ] A  double-ended queue  (deque)  is  a  linear  list  in  which  additions  and  deletions  may  be made   at   either   end.   Obtain   a   data   representation   mapping   a   deque   into   a   one-dimensional  array.  Write  C++  program  to  simulate  deque  with  functions  to  add  and delete elements from either end of the deque.

### Assignment-32 :
- [ ] Pizza  parlor  accepting  maximum  M  orders.  Orders  are  served  in  first  come  first  served basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system using circular queue using array.
