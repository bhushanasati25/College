# OOP and Computer Graphics Laboratory 


## Object Oriented Programming


## [Group A]()

### Assignment-1 :
- [ ] Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the following
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
2. Overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3. Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4. Overload operators << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers

### Assignment-2 :
- [ ] Develop a program in C++ to create a database of student’s information system containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address,  Telephone  number,  Driving  license  no.  and  other.  Construct  the  database  with suitable  member  functions.  Makeuse  of  constructor,  default  constructor,  copy  constructor, destructor,  static  member  functions,  friend  class,  this  pointer,  inline  code  and  dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling

### Assignment-3 :
- [ ] Imagine  a  publishing  company which  does  marketing  for  book  and  audio  cassette  versions. Create  a  class  publication that  stores the  title  (a string)  and price  (type  float) of  publications.  From  this  class  derive  two  classes:  book  which  adds  a  page  count  (type  int)  and  tape  which adds a playing time in minutes (type float).Write  a  program  that  instantiates  the  book  and  tape  class,  allows  user  to  enter  data  and displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values.

## [Group B]()

### Assignment-4 :
- [ ] Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file, open it again as an input file and read the information from the file

### Assignment-5 :
- [ ] Write a function template for selection sort that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array

## [Group C]()

### Assignment-6 :
- [ ] Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as personal records (Name, DOB, Telephone number etc) using vector container

- [ ] Write  C++  program  using  STL  for  sorting  and  searching  userdefined  records  such  as  Item records (Item code, name, cost, quantity etc) using vector container.

### Assignment-7 :
- [ ] Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states and the  values  will  be  the  populations  of  the  states.  When  the  program  runs,  the  user  is prompted  to  type  the  name  of  a  state.  The  program  then  looks  in  the  map,  using  the  state name as an index and returns the population of the state


## Computer Graphics

### Assignment-3-B :
- [ ] Write  C++  program  to  draw  the following pattern. Use DDA line and Bresenham‘s circle drawing algorithm. Apply the concept of encapsulation.
![]()

## [Group B]()

### Assignment-4-A :
- [ ] Write C++ program to draw 2-D object and perform following basic transformations, Scaling b) Translation c) Rotation. Apply the concept of operator overloading.

### Assignment-4-B :
- [ ] Write  C++  program  to  implement  translation,  rotation  and  scaling  transformations  on equilateral triangle and rhombus. Apply the concept of operator overloading.

### Assignment-5-A :
- [ ] Write C++ program to generate snowflake using concept of fractals.

### Assignment-5-B :

## [Group C]()

### Assignment-6-A :
- [ ] Design  and  simulate  any  data  structure  like  stack  or  queue  visualization  using  graphics. Simulation should include all operations performed on designed data structure. Implement the same using OpenGL.  

### Assignment-6-B :
- [ ] Write  C++  program  to  draw  3-D  cube  and  perform  following  transformations  on  it  using OpenGL i) Scaling ii) Translation iii) Rotation about an axis (X/Y/Z).

### Assignment-6-C :
- [ ] Write OpenGL program to draw Sun Rise and Sunset

### Assignment-7-A :
- [ ] Write   a   C++   program   to   control   a   ball   using   arrow   keys.   Apply   the   concept   of polymorphism

### Assignment-7-B :
- [ ] Write a C++ program to implement bouncing ball using sine wave form. Apply the concept of polymorphism.
