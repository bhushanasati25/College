// A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward.
// Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored.
// For example, ‖Poor Dan is in a droop‖ is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters ―poor danisina droop‖ and observing that they are the same forward and backward.
// One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. 
// Write C++ program with functions-
// 1. Tocheck whether given string is palindrome or not that uses a stack to determine whethera string is apalindrome.
// 2. to remove spaces and punctuation in string, convert all the Characters to lowercase, and then callabove Palindrome checking function to check for a palindrome
// 3. to print string in reverse order using stack
