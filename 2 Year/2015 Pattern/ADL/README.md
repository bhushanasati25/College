## Group B

### Assignment-9 :

1. Use adjacency list representation of the graph and find runtime of the function
2. Use adjacency matrix representation of the graph and find runtime of the function

### Assignment-10 :
- [x] There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight takesto reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be represented by airport nameor name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Justify thestorage representation used.

You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.

### Assignment-12 :
- [ ] Tour operator organizes guided bus trips across the Maharashtra. Tourists may have different preferences.  Tour  operator  offers  a  choice  from  many  different  routes.  Every  day  the  bus moves from starting citySto another cityF as chosen by client. Onthis way, the tourists can see the sights alongside the route travelled from S to F. Client may have preference to choose route. There is a restriction on the routes that the tourists may choose from, the bus has to take a short route fromStoF or a route having one distance unit longer than the minimal distance. Two routes fromStoFare considered different if there is at least one road from a cityAto a cityBwhich is part of one route, but not of the other route.

### Assignment-13 :
- [ ] Consider the scheduling problem. n tasks to be scheduled on single processor. Let t1, ..., tn be durations required to execute on single processor is known. The tasks can be executed in any order but one task at a time. Design a greedy algorithm for this problem and find a schedule that minimizes the total time spent by all the tasks in the system. (The time spent by one is the sum of the waiting time of task and the time spent on its execution.)  

## Group C 

### Assignment-14 :
- [x] Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number.

### Assignment-15 :
- [x] Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing.Data:  Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys must be uniqueStandard Operations:  Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

### Assignment-16 :
- [ ] For given set of elements create skip list. Find the element in the set that is closest to some given value. 

### Assignment-17 :
- [ ] The symbol table is generated by compiler.From this perspective, the symbol table is a set of name-attribute pairs.In a symbol table for a compiler, the name is an identifier, and the attributes might include an initial value and a list of lines that use the identifier.Perform the following operations on symbol table:
1. Determine if a particular name is in the table
2. Retrieve the attributes of that name
3. Modify the attributes of that name
4. Insert a new name and its attributes
5. Delete a name and its attributes

## Group D

Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword

## Group E

### Assignment-20 :

Display  information  of particular employee.  If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details.Use sequential file to main the data.

### Assignment-24 :
- [ ] Company  maintains  employee  information  as  employee  ID,  name,  designation  and  salary. Allow  user  to  add,  delete  information  of  employee.  Display  information  of particular employee.  If employee does not exist an appropriate message is displayed.
