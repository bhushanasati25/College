Design a linked allocation system to represent and manipulate univariate polynomials with integer coefficients (use circular linked lists with head nodes). Each term of the polynomial will berepresented as a node Thus. a node in this system will have three data members as below: 
To  erase  polynomials  efficiently,  we  need  to  use  an  available-space  list  and  associated functions. The external (i.e.. for input or output) representation of a univariate polynomial will be assumed to be a sequence of integers of the form: n,  c1,  e1,c2.  e2.  c3.  e3 .  .  ,  cnenwhere eirepresents an exponent and cia coefficient; n gives the number of terms in the polynomial.

## [Group C](https://github.com/mohitkhedkar/College/tree/main/2%20Year/DSL/Group%20C)

### Assignment-23 :
A palindrome is a string  of character  that‘s  the same forward  and backward. Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, ‖Poor Dan is in a droop‖ is a palindrome, as can  be seen by  examining  the characters  ―poor danisina droop‖ and observing  that  they  are    the  same    forward  and  backward.  One  way  to  check      for  a palindrome  is  to  reverse    the  characters  in  the  string  and  then  compare  with  them  the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with functions-
 1. Tocheck whether given string is palindrome or not that uses a stack to determine whethera string is apalindrome.
 2. to  remove  spaces  and punctuation in string, convert all the Characters to lowercase, and then callabove Palindrome checking function to check for a palindrome  
 3.  to print string in reverse order using stack

A classic problem that can be solved by backtracking is called the Eight Queens problem, which comes from the game of chess. The chess board   consistsof 64 square arranged in an 8 by 8 grid. The board normally   alternates between black and white square, but this is not relevant for the present problem. The queen can move as far as she wants in any direction, as  long as  she  follows a straight line, Vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. WriteC++ program  with  recursive  function  for  generating  all  possible  configurations  for  4-queen's problem.

## [Group D](https://github.com/mohitkhedkar/College/tree/main/2%20Year/DSL/Group%20D)

### Assignment-28 :
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue. 

### Assignment-29 :
Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an inorder List to store the items in the queue. Create a class that includes the data items(which should be template) and the priority (which should be int)The inorder list should contain  these objects ,with operator <= overloaded so that the  items with highest priority appear at the beginning of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)

### Assignment-30 :
